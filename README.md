# This project focuses on plotting a frequency distribution graph by crawling a webpage and using the commonly used words in that webpage as coordinates.


## The first part of the program is used to crawl the given webpage and print all the words that are found on the webpage

## In the second part we remove all the HTML tags and we beautify the text so that it changes into a readable format

## In the third part we convert the extracted words into tokens 

## In the next part we count the frequency of the words in the form of key value pairs 

## In the next part we plot the frequency distribution graph 

## In the final part of the program we remove all the stopwords that are unnecessary and plot the final graph with only the important words
